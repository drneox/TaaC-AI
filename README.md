# AI-driven Threat Modeling-as-a-Code (TaaC)

It leverages AI (via OpenAI's GPT models) to analyze service descriptions, identify security threats, visualize data flow and suggest remediations based on the STRIDE framework and OWASP guidelines. The script generates in-depth HTML report and includes feature for manual risk assessment.

## How It Works

- **YAML File Processing:** Loads and validates a YAML file containing the service details
- **AI Threat Analysis:** If an OpenAI API key is provided, the script uses AI to generate a comprehensive threat modeling analysis
- **Data Flow Generation:** Automatically generates a visual representation of the data flow within the service
- **Manual Risk Management:** Users can manually add, modify, or cross out risks in the generated report
- **Report Generation:** Produces a detailed HTML report, including both AI-generated and manually added risks

## Model supported

- GPT-3.5
- GPT-4
- Claude (Planned)
- Mistral 7b (Planned)
- Palm-2-chat-bison (Future)
- yi-34b-chat (Future)
- llama-2-70b (Future)

## Set API Key

Set the openai api key as an environment variable OPENAI_KEY in your operating system

Linux/Mac

```bash
export OPENAI_KEY=sk-ApiKeyExample
```

Windows

```bash
set OPENAI_KEY=sk-ApiKeyExample
```

## Install dependencies 

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use ‚ùì

1. Create a valid service description using [these guidelines](src/template.md)
2. Execute the script
```bash
python3 TaaC-AI.py <path_to_yaml_file>
```
3. Open generate .html report
4. Review AI-driven Threat Modeling Analysis table, and for false positives or resolved issues, mark the 'Status' checkbox
5. Add manually identified threats to the Manual Threat Modeling Analysis table (optional)
6. Download the report via the Download Report button
